# pandas==1.3.3 #1.3.3 is incompatible with Python 3.10, pushed constraint to next version that is compatible with 3.10
# pandas==1.3.4
numpy==1.21.2
pillow==10.2.0


# The conflict is caused by:
#     The user requested pytz==2017.2
#     apscheduler 3.3.1 depends on pytz
#     tzlocal 1.4 depends on pytz
#     pandas 1.3.4 depends on pytz>=2017.3

# To fix this you could try to:
# 1. loosen the range of package versions you've specified
# 2. remove package versions to allow pip to attempt to solve the dependency conflict
